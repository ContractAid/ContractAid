# ContractAid-EthDenver

ContractAid-EthDenver is a Proof of Concept (PoC) project created for EthDenver. The repository contains the code for contractAid.io Solidity Checker, which is designed to detect missing critical operational/transactional defects in your Solidity code according to the criteria of Solidity Checklist.

## Problem Statement
Recently, approximately 80% of smart contracts are deployed without external audit. This is often due to the time and cost involved in asking audit agencies or setting up bug bounty programs.

## Solution
ContractAid offers a quick 5-minute checker with clear and visual explanations. You don't need to be a security expert to deploy your decentralized applications (dApps) confidently. With ContractAid, you can deploy your application with confidence.
